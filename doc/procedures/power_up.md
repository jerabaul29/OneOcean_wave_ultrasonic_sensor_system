When powering up:

- make sure that all the sensors etc that you want to use are already plugged in and ready to use
- make sure that all the cables inside the logger box are well inserted
- make sure that ethernet is plugged in in advance if you want to see any UDP broadcast output

When all these points are done, just plug in the 220v cable into the 220V socket.
