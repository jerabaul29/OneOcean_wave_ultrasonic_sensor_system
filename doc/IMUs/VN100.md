- The first thing to do will be to program the VN100 to output the right kind of data, in the same way as indicated at: https://github.com/jerabaul29/LoggerWavesInIce/blob/master/Logger_GPS_SD_VN_Binary_output/README.txt .
- To make sure that it is correctly programmed, on a linux computer: first find which tty the VN100 is spitting to (here take for example ```/dev/ttyUSB0```), then:

```
$ stty -F /dev/ttyUSB0 57600
$ tail -f /dev/ttyUSB0 > some_example_file  # stop after a few seconds
$ xxd some_example_file  # and check by hand for the needed headers; should see some headers "fa 14 3e 00 3a 00" coming up regularly; if not, the VN100 is wrongly set up
```

- once this is done, cut the main cable coming out of the VN100 (as far as possible from the VN100), and extract the wires.
- The VN100 will need a level shifter to talk to the Arduino; use a MAX3323EEPE+ ; see drawing schematics in the **arduino\_shield** pictures folder
