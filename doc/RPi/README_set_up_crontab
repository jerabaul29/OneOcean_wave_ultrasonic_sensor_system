# Preparation

Make sure that all software is installed and everything is ready.

# Checking that all works well

Check that all the scripts in this folder work, by launching them by hand as a user:

https://github.com/jerabaul29/ultrasound_radar_bow_wave_sensor_Statsraad_Lehmkuhl_2021_2022/tree/main/code/launch_scripts

# Automatic startup

To set up the crontab, need to write the command:

https://github.com/jerabaul29/ultrasound_radar_bow_wave_sensor_Statsraad_Lehmkuhl_2021_2022/blob/main/code/rpi_cron_content 

to the NON sudo cron, i.e ```crontab -e```
